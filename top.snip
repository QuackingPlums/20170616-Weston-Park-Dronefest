					<h3>Race event:</h3>
						<p>
							Weston Park is an annual model show, and is the spiritual home of UK FPV.<br>
							For the first time ever, this event was a British Championship Qualifying Event, ERSA Eurocup qualifier, and FAI World Cup.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was a pleasure to work with Kwad Club, Kent Club, BFPVRA, Thomas from Ragg-e frames, Richard from iFPV, and countless others, and it goes to show what can be achieved when we work together! We look forward to doing more events this way!
						</p>
					<h3>Format:</h3>
						<p>
							66 pilots competed in 11 heats of 6.<br>
							Six rounds of qualifying, top 24 go through to elimination finals on the Sunday.<br>
							Races over 2 minutes, no race-distance limit.<br>
							Competitors are ranked after each round by number of laps completed and time taken, and round-by-round (RBR) scoring awards points based on ranking.<br>
							Overall Qualifying positions are calculated from each competitor's best three scores.
						</p>
						<p>
							The following results come straight from the timing software, prior to corrections and amendments.
